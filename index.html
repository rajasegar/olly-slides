	    <h2>What is Observability?</h2>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Mathematical definition</h3>
	    <p>Observability is defined as a measure of how well internal states of a system
	      can be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.
	    </p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Applying Observability to Software Systems</h3>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Understand the inner workings of your application</li>
	      <li>Understand any system state you application may have gotten itself into</li>
	      <li>Understanding the things above, <span class="yellow">only</span> by observing that with external tools</li>
	      <li>Understand that state, no matter how extreme or unusual</li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h2>Litmus test</h2>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Can you continually answer open-ended questions about the inner workings of your software to explain any anomalous values?</li>
	      <li>Can you understand what any particular user of your software may be experiencing?</li>
	      <li>Can you determine the things above even if this anomaly has never happened before?</li>
	      <li>Can you ask arbitrary questions about your system and find answers without needing to predict what those anomalies would be in advance?</li>
	      <li>And can you do these things without having to ship any new code to handle or describe that state?</li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Observability for software systems is a measure of how well you can understand and explain any state your system can get into,
	    no matter how novel or bizarre.</p>

	    <h3>Mischaracterizations of Observability for Software </h3>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>3 pillars</h3>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Metrics</li>
	      <li>Logs</li>
	      <li>Traces</li>
	    </ol>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Observability is <span class="yellow">not achieved by gluing together disparate tools</span> with marketing.
	      There is <span class="yellow">not one specific tool</span> you must adopt in order to get observability in your software systems.
	    </p>
	  </section>

	    <h3>Why Observability matters now?</h3>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Why are metrics and monitoring not enough?</h3>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Debugging with metrics vs observability</h3>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Cardinality</h3>
	    <p>Cardinality matters for observability, because high-cardinality information
	      is the most useful data fro debugging or understanding a system.
	      </p>
	  </section>
	  <section>
	    <h3>Debugging with Observability</h3>
	  </section>
	  <section><p>
	      Monitoring creates a <span class="yellow">fundamentally reactive approach</span> to system management.
	  </p></section>
	  <section>
	    <p>Observability tools encourage developers to gather rich telemetry for every possible event that
	      could occur, passing along the full context of any given request and storing it for possible use at some
	    point down the line.</p>
